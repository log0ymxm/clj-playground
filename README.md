Various algorithms implemented in clojure. Just a learning exercise.

## Numeric

- *Euclid's Algorithm*: Finding the greatest common denominator of a list of numbers
- *Gauss-Jordan Elimination*: Linear algebra; Reducing a system of equations to find solutions.
- *Fast Fourier Transform*: A discrete fourier transform, for converting a time measure into a frequency.
- *Fourier Motzkin Elimination*: Reduction of a system of linear inequalities.
